# Multivariable-feedback-controller
This repository hosts the implementation of a Multivariable Controller for the Reactive Ion Etching (RIE) process, originally introduced in an academic course project. It builds upon the principles outlined in HW10, enhancing the control design through the application of a MIMO control strategy using a linear quadratic regulator and loop transfer.
